# 3-Stage Pipeline:
# IF (Instruction Fetch): Fetches instructions from memory.
# ID/EX (Instruction Decode/Execute): Decodes instructions, generates control signals, and prepares operands for execution.
# MEM/WB (Memory Write-back): Writes back results to registers or memory.

# CSR Support:
# Control and Status Registers for managing processor behavior.
# Handles tasks such as interrupt handling, privilege levels, and power management.
